1. mincostpath.py - Implements Dijkstra's algorithm to search for the shortest cost route to navigate a grid.
2. interval_q1.py - Determines the maximum number of non-overlapping intervals.
3. interval_q2.py - Finds the maximum number of intervals that overlap at a single point (on x-axis).
4. interval_q3.py - Computes the largest contiguous interval obtained by taking a union of some of the input intervals.
5. Divide-and-conquer algorithm that processes sorted and rotated integer sequences. 
6. jewels.py - Dynamic programming solution to the Necklace Jewel Distribution problem
